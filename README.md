# Icons8 WPF Framework

Windows 8 UI framework by Icons8 is a free set of UI controls that can be used for designing better user interfaces for Windows.

**Why did we make it?**
We feel sorry for the mediocre design of Windows apps. For the most part, they are like an uncool kid trying to match the cool kids: mobile applications, Mac OS, and web.

So we’ve saved some pocket money to develop a framework. We picture a better world where:
1. Windows developers create beautiful applications.
2. UI designers create mockups 3x faster.

**What’s Done**
Right now it has a number of templates and 200 icons, all open sourced. If you don’t need the mockups, feel free to use the icons separately.

**Set includes:**
- 200 Free SVG icons
- Off-canvas menu 
- Grid with sorting 
- Toolbar 
- One-level Ribbon 
- Search 
- Form elements 
- Input box 
- Buttons 
- Radio button, checkbox, combo box etc.
